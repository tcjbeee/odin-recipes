    <h4>Steps to make:</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Combine cut chicken, 1 cup heavy cream, lemon juice, ginger, cumin, pepper, cinnamon, salt, and cayenne pepper in a bowl and allow to marinate in the refrigerator for 1 hour or more.</li>
        <li>When chicken is marinated to your liking, heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large pan over medium heat; saut√© onion, jalapeno, and garlic until softened, about 5 minutes. Add tomato sauce and tomato paste and bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Heat remaining oil in another skillet over medium to medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook and stir until browned and no longer pink in the center, 7 to 10 minutes. Add more heavy cream as desired to obtain a light red sauce mixture. Stir and let simmer until flavors have melded, 10 to 15 minutes. Serve.</li>
